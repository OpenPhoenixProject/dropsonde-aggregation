# dropsonde-aggregation
Geenerate aggregated public datasets from private telemetry metrics.

Each Tuesday, the queries in this repository run to aggregate private data
reported by the [Dropsonde telemetry client](https://github.com/puppetlabs/dropsonde).

The last run is: ![Aggregate all data](https://github.com/puppetlabs/dropsonde-aggregation/workflows/Aggregate%20all%20data/badge.svg?event=schedule)
